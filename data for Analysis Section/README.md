# Illustration

For ablation study in Section 5.1 and effects of pacing function in 5.3, these experiments can be easily re-implemented by changing inputs, parameters, or commenting out a few lines of code.
All code and data are provided and please refer to ./algorithm_classification, ./code_clone_detection, and ./codesearch for details.


# Data

For effects of augmentation type in Section 5.2, the data can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5713901). "train_no_decl.jsonl", "train_no_api.jsonl" and "train_no_control.jsonl" represent equal-sized datasets that do not contain transformations of declaration, API and control structure, respectively.
